# Getting Started

## Installation

First, make sure you have [Unity 6](https://unity.com/de/releases/unity-6) or newer installed. Now, download
CGRust and copy the CGRust folder from the assets folder into your own project. If there are no compilation errors,
the library is installed.

For checking if it works correctly, head to the Samples folder and try starting one of the scenes.
