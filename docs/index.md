# Introduction

**CGRust* is a library written in Rust containing computational geometry algorithms used in Games, Simulations, CADs, etc.
The rust implementation is open-source and can be found [here](https://github.com/blenderfan/cg-rust).

The **Wrapper**, which this documentation is about, exposes the functionality of that libary to Unity, to enable the use of
fast and safe computational geometry algorithms in C#.
